# SHRIMP
This is a final project for the Astronomy and Statistics course at Olin College of Engineering. This code takes audio data from an underwater sculpture and identify timestamps when fish noises occur, which are then saved in a CSV. It also records the amount of boat noise in the area and then plots the fish noises and the boat noise level together.

The research code folder contains our code that we used to design our deliverable code. The deliverable code folder is our final code that can be run from main.py. In order to analyze your audio file, it needs to be in .WAV format and main.py must be edited so that the file path specified reaches your file. This program works best on audio files that are smaller than 1 hour in length.
